          Welcome to <strong>Feng Shui Koi</strong>, where the wisdom of Feng
          Shui meets the timeless beauty of koi fish. Our platform is designed
          to provide personalized recommendations for koi fish based on your
          gender and birth year, aligning with your specific Feng Shui elements
          and life energy. We believe that through the right choice of koi fish,
          you can create a harmonious balance that enhances your well-being and
          prosperity.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          At <strong>Feng Shui Koi</strong>, we’ve simplified the process of
          aligning your life energy with the positive influences of koi fish. By
          collecting basic details—such as your gender and birth year—we
          calculate your Feng Shui <em>bản mệnh</em> (life element). Based on
          your unique <em>bản mệnh</em>, we suggest koi fish that will help
          balance your energy and bring good fortune into your life.<br></br>{" "}
          Each koi fish carries its own symbolism and energy, and our
          recommendations are designed to help you choose fish that harmonize
          with your personal Feng Shui elements. Whether you are seeking koi for
          your personal pond, business, or just exploring the fascinating world
          of Feng Shui, we have the insights you need.
        </p>

        <h2>Advertiser-Friendly Platform</h2>

          <strong>Feng Shui Koi</strong> is not just a space for koi
          enthusiasts; it’s also an ideal platform for advertisers in the koi
          industry. Our platform offers advertisers the opportunity to promote

          koi maintenance services, we make sure your products or services are
